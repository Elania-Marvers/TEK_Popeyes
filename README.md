It allows the packaging of applications, and the runtime environments (down to the operating systems) they need, which in return allows them to work wherever Docker is installed.

Like the brave sailor that Popeye is, containers can also confidently sail across the vast ocean of operating
systems and configurations, being sure of working wherever they might end. As such, containers can be used on any host OS where Docker is installed.
